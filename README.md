Image classification are becoming more important in various industry fields. For example, in autonomous automobile manufacture, image classification are necessary because it can support self-driving cars in detecting and recognizing other objects such as other vehicles, pedestrians, animals, traffic lights on the road. In healthcare system, image classification can support health professionals in diagnosing patient’s health problems or diseases such as lung disease, heart disease, and cancer. In addition, image classification can be used to automatically categorize products on e-commerce websites, which can result in better customer’s experience because customers can find relevant products quickly. Image classification also can promote the development of security sector such as surveillance, and facial recognition, since it can be used to identify person, objects, and then potential threats can be addressed quickly. Due to various applications of image classification, this project aims at developing a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) which can perform image classification task well, using CIFAR-10 dataset. Particularly, several CNN architectures were conducted, and a comparison between these architecture’s performance was carried out to find out a CNN model which can achieve the best performance, and generate good prediction on unknown datasets.
